# Snake-Game-in-Python

Snake is a video game genre where the player maneuvers a line that grows bigger after eating something, typically apples, making the snake a primary obstacle to itself. [Snake (video game genre)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snake_(video_game_genre))

This game was written in python from a OOP perspective.

This was a simple project for me to practice a developer workflow with git.
